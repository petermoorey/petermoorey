### Hello 👋

I manage a talented Network Automation, Monitoring and Tooling team, and I'm responsible for the architecture and design of a large/complex global network.

My primary focus is managing a remote team of Engineers (six different nationalities) focused on network automation, monitoring and tooling.  We use modern software/technology to develop really exciting apps, processes, and solutions which bring significant benefit and value.  

I'm also responsible for evaluating new networking technologies, defining network strategy/roadmaps and commercializing new solutions, and their related IT standards.  Some of my key achievements include leading a multi-million dollar global wireless upgrade at 600 facilities, global Network Access Control implementation for wired and wireless connectivity, and establishing a network automation team from the ground up.

Outside of work I enjoy:
- ☕️ Relaxation of making and drinking nice coffee
- 🐕 [Walking](https://500px.com/photo/1043822168/winter-walk-in-aberdeenshire-by-peter-moorey) our dog in the beautfiul Scottish countryside
- ✈️ Travelling with my wife, we've visited 30 states whilst living in the US
- 📷 [Photography](https://500px.com/p/PeterMoorey?view=photos) using my Fuji X100F (travel), Canon 6D (landscape) and AE1 (film) cameras
