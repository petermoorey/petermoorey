### Hello 👋

I manage a global team of Architects and Engineers who are responsible for the architecture and design of a large/complex global network, defining global IT standards, automation and tooling, and commercialising new network products/solutions.

My responsibilities include all aspects of IT service management, such people management, career planning, budgeting/finances, defining IT strategy and roadmaps.

Some of my key achievements include:
- Delivering a multi-million dollar global wireless infrastructure upgrade program covering 600 facilities.
- Commercialising and automating the deployment of a global Network Access Control solution for wired and wireless connectivity.
- Building a network automation team and delivered a roadmap of high-impact products over multiple years.

Outside of work I enjoy:
- ☕️ Relaxation of making and drinking nice coffee
