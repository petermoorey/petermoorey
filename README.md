### Hello 👋

I manage a talented Network Automation, Monitoring and Tooling team, and I'm responsible for the architecture and design of a large/complex global network.

My primary focus is managing a remote team of Engineers focused on network automation, monitoring and tooling.  We use agile practices and modern software/technologies to develop really exciting apps, processes, and solutions which add huge value to IT and our business directly.  

I'm also responsible for evaluating new networking technologies, defining network strategy/roadmaps and commercializing new solutions, and their related IT standards.  Some of my key achievements include multi-million dollar wireless upgrade at 600 facilities, global Network Access Control implementation for wired and wireless connectivity, and establishing a network automation team.

Outside of work I enjoy:
- ☕️ Relaxation of making and drinking nice coffee
- 🐕 [Walking](https://500px.com/photo/1043822168/winter-walk-in-aberdeenshire-by-peter-moorey) our dog in the beautfiul Scottish countryside
- ✈️ Travelling with my wife, we've visited 30 states whilst living in the US
